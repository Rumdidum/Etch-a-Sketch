### Functionality

- Hold down mousebutton to draw....
  - thats how it should work, but unfortunatly it just draws when you click the desired color mode 
    and you cannot prevent from filling the squares until you move out of the "drawing Area".
- mininum squares 16 and maximum 64 sqaures for performance reasons.
- 


### Thoughts

- I learned how to generate squares with javascript
  - as well as when to reassign a variable 
  - my brain seems to get better with the DOM in general
- Used "clead code" prinziples to rename my variables
  - noun and adjectives
- Used "clead code" prinziples to rename my functions
  - used verbs
- Tried to implement "removeEventListener" but failed becouse i need to iterate over
  generated squares. Unfortunatly in my current condition I' am not able to pass named functions 
  with parameters to "addEventListener('click', namedFunction(parameterNotworking))" without breaking
  the programm.
  - It is unnecessary to use "removeListener()" as it is better to change listeners as they are always
    in use generaly.
- Was forced to learn Flexbox again for the nth time
